# Effect-of-air-quality-on-mental-health


## Abstract
Previous studies that analyze the welfare loss of air quality seldom pay attention to its potential impact on people’s subjective well-being. 

This project attempts to fill the gap by investigating the impact of air quality on mental health status. We match a nationwide lon- gitudinal survey in China with city-level air quality.

By making use of variations in exposure to air pollution for the same individuals over time, we show that people’s mental health is ***significantly correlated*** with air quality – better air quality can lead to better overall mental health. We test several alternative specifications including weather condition, lagged effect effect of air quality, and specific chronic diseases. This paper further conduct a placebo test and investigate the heterogeneous effect of our results.
